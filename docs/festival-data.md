# Festival data, demo content and moderation

How festival schedules get into Festie, how the App Review demo is prepared, and how
reported content is handled. Everything here goes through `apps/admin-tools`, a small
TypeScript CLI that talks to Supabase with the **service-role** key. Contract:
[`v1-architecture.md`](./v1-architecture.md) §2 and §6.

```sh
export SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service role / secret key>   # or SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
npm run admin -- help
```

Never put the service-role key in the mobile app, a `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variable or a commit.
Commands that write accept `--dry-run`; run it first. `festival:validate`, `festival:import-csv`,
`festival:shift-dates` and the `--dry-run` of `festival:seed`/`demo:seed` work without credentials.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `festival:validate <file>` | Strict offline validation of a festival file |
| `festival:seed <file> [--dry-run]` | Validate, diff and write a festival; bumps `version` |
| `festival:import-csv <dir> [--out <file>]` | Four CSV files → festival JSON (validated) |
| `festival:shift-dates <file> --start <YYYY-MM-DD> [--out <file>] [--dry-run]` | Move a **demo** festival to new dates |
| `demo:seed [--file <file>] [--dry-run]` | Demo festival + fake crew for App Review |
| `reports:list [--status …] [--limit n] [--json]` | Moderation queue (default: open, oldest first) |
| `reports:remove-content <report_id> [--dry-run]` | Remove reported content, mark reports actioned |
| `users:ban <user_id> [--dry-run]` | Ban an account and remove it from every group |
| `moderation:list-terms` / `add-terms` / `remove-terms` | Manage the disallowed-words list |

Paths are resolved from the directory you run `npm run admin` in, then from the repo root.

## 1. Festival file format

One JSON file per festival (see [`seed-data/demo-festival.json`](../seed-data/demo-festival.json)):

```json
{
  "festival": { "id": "…", "name": "…", "start_date": "2027-08-06", "end_date": "2027-08-08",
                "timezone": "America/Chicago", "status": "draft", "source_url": "https://…" },
  "stages":  [{ "id": "…", "name": "Main Stage", "zone": "North", "latitude": 41.87, "longitude": -87.62 }],
  "artists": [{ "id": "…", "name": "…", "genre": "Indie Rock" }],
  "sets":    [{ "id": "…", "artist_id": "…", "stage_id": "…",
                "start_time": "2027-08-06T19:30:00-05:00", "end_time": "2027-08-06T20:30:00-05:00" }]
}
```

Validation is strict — unknown fields are errors, so typos never silently drop data.

**festival**

| Field | Rules |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID (stable forever — users' groups and picks hang off it) |
| `name` | 1–120 characters, the festival's public name |
| `start_date`, `end_date` | Calendar dates `YYYY-MM-DD` in the festival's local calendar; end ≥ start |
| `timezone` | IANA zone (`America/Chicago`, `Europe/London`), never an abbreviation |
| `venue_name` | Optional, ≤ 120 |
| `status` | `draft` (default) or `published`; only published festivals are visible to the app |
| `is_demo` | `true` only for the sample festival (shown with a "Sample" badge, sorted last) |
| `source_url` | **Required** unless `is_demo`: `https://` link to the official public schedule used |
| `accent_color` | Optional `#RRGGBB`, used as a fill colour in the app (pick a light/pastel tone) |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | Optional map centre (both or neither) |
| `default_zoom` | Optional, 0–22 (app default 15) |
| `bounds_sw_lat`, `bounds_sw_lng`, `bounds_ne_lat`, `bounds_ne_lng` | Optional bounding box (all four or none); must contain the centre |
| `version` | Optional floor; `festival:seed` always writes `max(stored + 1, version)` |
| `image_url`, `map_asset_url` | Must be absent/null (no festival artwork — see §3) |

**stages**: `id` (UUID), `name` (≤ 80, unique per festival), optional `zone` (≤ 40), optional
`latitude`/`longitude` (inside the festival bounds when bounds are set). Stages without
coordinates still work but do not get a map pin. `festival_id` may be omitted.

**artists**: `id` (UUID), `name` (≤ 120, unique in the file), optional `genre` (≤ 60). Artists are a
global table shared by all festivals; use the same id for the same act across festivals
(the CSV importer does this automatically). No `image_url`.

**sets**: `id` (UUID), `artist_id` and `stage_id` referencing entries in the same file, `start_time`
and `end_time` as ISO 8601 **with an explicit offset** (`-05:00` or `Z`), `end_time` after
`start_time`, at most 24 h long, starting on a local date between `start_date − 1 day` and
`end_date + 1 day`. Optional `set_type` (default `performance`). Overlapping sets on one stage
produce a warning.

A late-night set at 00:30 belongs to the previous festival day in the app (days start at 06:00
local time), so write the real calendar timestamp: `2027-08-08T00:30:00-05:00` for "Saturday night,
12:30 AM".

## 2. CSV import

For entering a schedule by hand, keep four CSV files in one directory and convert them:

```sh
npm run admin -- festival:import-csv path/to/riverside-2027 --out seed-data/riverside-2027.json
```

[`seed-data/demo-festival-csv/`](../seed-data/demo-festival-csv) is a complete example (it is the source
of `demo-festival.json`; a unit test keeps the two identical).

| File | Required columns | Optional columns |
|---|---|---|
| `festival.csv` (exactly one row) | `name, start_date, end_date, timezone` | `id, venue_name, source_url, status, is_demo, accent_color, latitude, longitude, default_zoom, bounds_sw_lat, bounds_sw_lng, bounds_ne_lat, bounds_ne_lng` |
| `stages.csv` | `name` | `id, zone, latitude, longitude` |
| `artists.csv` | `name` | `id, genre` |
| `sets.csv` | `artist, stage, start, end` | `id, set_type` |

- Standard CSV: quote fields containing commas (`"Juniper & the Low Moons, Live"`), double inner quotes.
  Header names are case-insensitive; unknown columns are errors.
- `sets.csv` refers to artists and stages **by name** (case-insensitive) or by id.
- Times are festival local time `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (converted with the festival time zone, DST-aware;
  a time skipped by a daylight-saving change is an error) or ISO 8601 with an offset.
- Ids you leave out are derived deterministically (UUID v5), so re-importing an updated schedule keeps
  them stable and users keep their picks: festival ← name + start date; stage ← festival + stage name;
  artist ← artist name (shared across festivals); set ← festival + artist + festival day (+ an
  ordinal if the act plays twice that day). Moving a set to another time or stage keeps its id;
  renaming an artist or stage changes it. If you must rename, put the old id in the `id` column.
- Errors are reported as `file:line column: message`; the output is then validated exactly like a
  hand-written JSON file.

## 3. Sourcing rules (read before entering a real festival)

Festie is an independent app, not affiliated with or endorsed by any festival, organizer or artist,
and the app says so (`FESTIVAL_DISCLAIMER` on the Fests list, Lineup and the schedule browser, a line in
Settings, and Terms §8). Data must keep it that way:

1. **Facts only.** Enter what the organizer has publicly announced: festival name, dates, venue,
   stage names, artist names and set times. Copy no descriptions, bios, editorial text or ticket info.
2. **Official public sources.** Use the festival's own published schedule (website or official app
   listing made public). Do not use leaked, paywalled or "rumoured" lineups or other apps' data.
   Record the page you used in `source_url` — it is required to publish and is how the data is audited
   and corrected later.
3. **Nominative names only.** Use names as plain text to identify the festival, stages and artists.
   No logos, wordmarks, posters, artwork, official maps, photos or brand colours copied from the
   festival — `image_url` and `map_asset_url` are rejected by the validator. Pick your own neutral
   `accent_color`.
4. **Coordinates** come from public map data (e.g. the venue's public address/park outline on
   OpenStreetMap), not from the festival's site map artwork.
5. **Keep it current.** Schedules change; re-check the source before the festival and update
   (§4). If an organizer asks for removal or correction, unpublish first (`"status": "draft"`) and then fix.

## 4. Publishing workflow

1. Enter the festival as CSV (or JSON) with `"status": "draft"`; validate:
   `npm run admin -- festival:validate seed-data/<festival>.json`
2. Seed the draft: `npm run admin -- festival:seed seed-data/<festival>.json --dry-run`, review the
   plan, then run it without `--dry-run`. Drafts are invisible to the app (RLS shows only
   `status = 'published'` to anon and signed-in users).
3. Review the data in the Supabase table editor against `source_url` (spot-check times in the
   festival time zone, stage names, late-night sets).
4. Publish: set `"status": "published"` in the file and seed again. The validator refuses to publish a
   real festival without `source_url` or without sets, and the database enforces
   `status = 'draft' or is_demo or source_url is not null`.
5. Updates: edit the file and seed again. `festival:seed` upserts the festival, artists, stages and
   sets, **deletes sets and stages of that festival that are no longer in the file** (users' picks of
   deleted sets are deleted with them; meetups pinned to a deleted stage lose the pin), and writes the
   bumped `version` and `status` last so clients refetch a complete bundle. Keep ids stable (§2).
6. Unpublish: set `"status": "draft"` and seed. Groups and picks stay in the database.

Migration 007 sets every legacy non-demo festival without a `source_url` to draft; real festivals
appear only after being entered through this workflow.

## 5. Demo festival and App Review

`seed-data/demo-festival.json` is the fictional **Festie Demo Fest** (`is_demo: true`, published,
June 2027) with fictional artists, placed in Central Park, New York (a large public open space) with
every stage inside the park. The app labels it "Sample".

Prepare the review build:

```sh
# Optional: move the demo so "now playing / up next" is live during review
npm run admin -- festival:shift-dates seed-data/demo-festival.json --start 2026-10-09 --out /tmp/demo.json
npm run admin -- demo:seed --file /tmp/demo.json --dry-run
npm run admin -- demo:seed --file /tmp/demo.json
```

`festival:shift-dates` keeps every set at the same local clock time (DST-safe) and refuses non-demo
festivals. Do not commit shifted dates unless you mean to.

`demo:seed` is idempotent and creates:

- the demo festival (via the same path as `festival:seed`);
- three fake members (`festie-demo-maya|jordan|sam@example.com`, confirmed auth users that can never
  receive mail, marked with `app_metadata.festie_demo = true`) with profiles; Maya is the admin;
- the group **"Festie Demo Crew"** (fixed id derived from the festival id, created by Maya) with their
  memberships and set picks. Its invite code is random, generated on the first seed and kept on
  re-seeds; it is never printed or derived from repository data (a group still carrying the guessable
  code earlier versions derived gets a fresh random code). Nobody but the reviewer is meant to join;
- a meetup by Jordan with a totem photo (`seed-data/demo-totem.jpg`, uploaded to the private
  `totems` bucket at `<group>/<meetup>/<uuid>.jpg`);
- live location rows near the stages.

Re-seeding also removes photos in the demo group's storage folder that no meetup references.

The reviewer signs in through the `demo-login` edge function (`DEMO_LOGIN_EMAIL` /
`DEMO_LOGIN_CODE`, see the release runbook). On every successful demo login,
`public.prepare_demo_account` (service role) recreates the reviewer's profile if needed, re-joins
them to "Festie Demo Crew", makes them follow the demo festival and places the fake members on the
map again with a fresh timestamp. The demo crew then stays current however long the reviewer keeps
the app open: `private.refresh_demo_crew` re-stamps the fake members' location rows (which otherwise
expire after 15 minutes) and moves their meetups that have started or start within 30 minutes to the
start of the current hour plus 2 hours. It runs on every demo login, whenever `get_group_locations` is called for the
demo crew (the map polls it) and every 5 minutes from the pg_cron job `refresh-demo-crew`; it is a no-op
for every other crew. The reviewer can delete the demo account in Settings and log in again with the
same code.

The demo crew is recognised by its creator, never by name alone: it is the "Festie Demo Crew" on a
published `is_demo` festival created by a profile whose auth user has `app_metadata.festie_demo =
true`. Only the service role can write `app_metadata` (users can edit their own `user_metadata`, which
is ignored), so a same-named group made by a real user is never chosen. On every demo login the crew
is reset to the fake members plus the reviewer: anyone else is removed together with the meetups they
posted there, blocks between the reviewer and the fake members are cleared (App Review tests Block on
the shared login; a leftover block would hide that member's location, meetups and picks from the next
reviewer), and live locations are only ever written for the fake members. After upgrading from a
build that seeded the demo before this marker existed, run `demo:seed` again (it adds the marker to
the existing fake users and replaces the guessable invite code).

## 6. Moderation

Users report profiles, groups, meetups and photos in the app (reasons: spam, harassment, hate,
sexual, violence, impersonation, other) and are told "we'll review this within 24 hours". Reports
are only writable through the `report_content` RPC (rate limited to 20 per user per day) and store
a snapshot of the reported text at report time. Users can also block each other (blocked users'
meetups, picks and locations disappear for both) and group admins can remove members.

**Daily review**

```sh
npm run admin -- reports:list                      # open reports, oldest first
npm run admin -- reports:list --status all --limit 200 --json
```

Each entry shows the target, the snapshot, details and the reporter. Then act:

- `npm run admin -- reports:remove-content <report_id> --dry-run` then without `--dry-run`:
  - `meetup` → deletes the meetup and its totem photo;
  - `photo` → deletes the photo from storage and clears `meetups.totem_path`;
  - `group` → renames the group to "My crew";
  - `user` → resets the display name to "Festie user" and the avatar to initials;
  - then every open/reviewed report about the same target is marked `actioned`.
  Storage is removed before rows, so a failed run can be retried safely.
- `npm run admin -- users:ban <user_id> [--dry-run]` (profile id or auth user id) for repeat or
  severe abuse: bans the auth user for 100 years (`ban_duration: 876000h`; sign-in and token refresh
  fail, and an access token already issued reads nothing from then on because the database treats a
  banned caller as having no profile, `private.is_banned`). Then `prepare_account_ban` removes all
  their group memberships and location rows with the same admin hand-off rules as leaving a group,
  gives every crew they were in a new invite code, deletes their meetups and returns every photo path
  to remove (their uploads, their meetups' photos and those of crews that became empty); the command
  removes those files and marks reports about them `actioned`. If storage removal fails, run it again
  (each step is idempotent). Their profile stays for the record.
- No action needed: set the report's `status` to `dismissed` (or `reviewed`) in the table editor.

**Disallowed words.** Display names, group names and meetup titles/notes are checked on insert and
on change against `public.moderation_terms` (whole-word, case-insensitive; the user sees "content not
allowed"). Matching is anchored on non-alphanumeric boundaries, so "Grape Escape" passes while
"rape" is blocked, and every inflection must be listed separately ("fuck", "fucking", …).
Migration `009_seed_moderation_terms.sql` seeds a starter list of common English profanity, slurs
and hate slogans, deliberately leaving out words that are also everyday words or names ("dick",
"cock", "pussy", "cum", "dyke", "coon", "homo").

```sh
npm run admin -- moderation:list-terms
npm run admin -- moderation:add-terms "white power" slurword slurwords --dry-run
npm run admin -- moderation:add-terms "white power" slurword slurwords
npm run admin -- moderation:remove-terms someword
```

Terms are stored lower-case, 2–60 characters of letters, digits, spaces, apostrophes and hyphens,
starting and ending with a letter or digit. Adding a term affects new writes and edits immediately;
existing names are not rescanned (find them in the table editor and use `reports:remove-content` or
edit directly). Database cascades (account deletion, group deletion) never re-run the check. To make
an addition part of every fresh environment, also append it to a new migration
(`insert into public.moderation_terms (term) values (...) on conflict do nothing;`) — never edit an
applied migration.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- `Missing SUPABASE_URL …` — export both variables; the anon key is never accepted.
- `PGRST205` / missing columns — the target project is missing migrations 006–009; apply them first.
- The reviewer lands in no crew after a demo login — `demo:seed` has not run against this project
  (or ran before the `festie_demo` app_metadata marker existed); run it again.
- `festivals_published_requires_source` — a real festival was published without `source_url`.
- Local schema tests: `npm run db:test` (throwaway Postgres 16; see `scripts/db-test.sh`).
